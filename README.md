## Overview

A payments system to manage bank accounts with `deposit`, `withdraw`, `dispute`, `resolve` & `chargeback` type transactions

## Build Status [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sean-halpin/bank_payments_system.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/sean-halpin/bank_payments_system)

The service is being built, linted & tested automatically on each commit with [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.com/github/sean-halpin/bank_payments_system)

## Coverage [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/sean-halpin/bank_payments_system/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=yxIQNIUAGJ)](https://codecov.io/gh/sean-halpin/bank_payments_system)

A test coverage report is being generated on the build pipeline with `grcov` and results of each build can be seen on [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/gh/sean-halpin/bank_payments_system)


## Service Layout

```
src
├── account_manager.rs
├── lib.rs
├── main.rs
├── tx_processor.rs
└── tx_stream_reader.rs
```

The `account_manager.rs` file contains the logic for processing transaction types.
Tests for the logic of those transactions are included in that file. 

The `tx_processor.rs` contains the logic for reading transactions and pushing them to the account manager. 

The `tx_stream_reader.rs` is reading lines & deserializing into `Transaction` structs. This gives us a mechanism to process a stream of transactions one by one & avoid loading the whole CSV into memory.

```
tests
└── integration_test.rs
```

A simple integration style test is run from `integration_test.rs`.  
This test is ingesting the `transactions.csv` in the project's root directory & will output a csv to stdout showing the account's latest status

```
transactions.csv
```

Some test data manually created to run against the application & integration test. 

## Build

```
$ cargo build
```

## Test 

```
$ cargo test
```

## Linting

```
cargo clippy
```

## Run 
 
### Locally 
```
$ cargo run -- transactions.csv
```
### Docker
```
$ docker build -t bps .
$ docker run -v $(pwd)/transactions.csv:/svc/app/transactions.csv -t bps transactions.csv
```

## Capture Output

Piping stdout to a file will yield a csv showing account status after transaction processing. 
```
$ cargo run -- transactions.csv > out.csv
$ cat out.csv
client,available,held,total,locked
1,1.5,0,1.5,false
2,2,0,2,false
4,2.3422,0.0000,2.3422,true
3,21.5578,0,21.5578,false
```

## Processing in parallel

- FIFO Queue per account
  - order matters per account
- Concurrent storage structure 
  - Hashmap with RwLock
    - Entries with Mutex
- Threadpool 
  - mpsc multi producer single consumer channel
  - pass results back to main thread

- Scaling the service itself
  - Sharded message delivery
    - Kafka
    - Rabbit hash exchange
  - Atomic Transactional DB
    - NoSQL, no schema, eventually consistend
    - Reltational DB, schema migrations, atomic transactions
